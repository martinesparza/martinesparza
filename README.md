### **Hello there!**
I’m Martín Esparza-Iaizzo, a biomedical engineer and neuroscientist from a small town in the north of Spain who is currently based in INBRAIN Neuroelectronics. Most of my code is not available but here are some of my public projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in neurological pathology and how technology can aid in clinical and pre-clinical research
- 🌱 I’m currently learning graphic design, animal methods, academic writing, closed-loop algorithm design and much more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on as many projects as possible. 
- 📫 You can reach me at: martinesparza22.me@gmail.com
